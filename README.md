In order to view the game you can clone the repository on your computer.
The are two important labeld files in the repository,
The "game" folder and the "Unity project folder"you can play the game by launching the game from the game folder (the one with the white logo).
If you want to look at the code you can open the unity folder with the right version of unity to view it.

Here is also a link to my design document regarding this project: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fakHMZwfV7zppTnb8aLzYLHSVO3B8TF3GlwtpDDC5jg/edit?usp=sharing
